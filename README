CHIP-8 emulator, coded in C++. Big shout out to Austin Morlan for his helpful guide posted here: https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/
It was a huge help to get me pointed in the right direction. It runs visuals but you need to have SDL2 installed on your IDE in order for this program
to compile and function. This emulator can run simple games like PONG and TETRIS. Coded on the Clion IDE.
